Hey, you! Hold up a minute! Who? You! You you YOU!!!
Don't pretend you don't know who I'm talkin' to! You ain't foolin' nobody!
Get your tail over here!
Hey! HEY!!! Where do you think you're goin', you little twerp? I SAID get over here!
Unbelievable! What are you doing?
Don't MAKE me chase you!
You're a real piece of work, you know that?
You think I was your colleague or the cat or somethin'? When I call you, I expect you to move. And I mean MOVE!
...Um, what was that? That look you just gave me. What, may I ask, was that?
Are you testin' me? You don't wanna do that! I'm warnin' you! You'll rue the day you started this!
And don't gimme that crybaby what-did-I-do? look either! It ain't gonna fly!!! Not with THIS mole!!!
FORGOT TO COMMIT! You just had to do it again, didn't you?
After all the kindness I been showin' you... You go and stab me in the back. What would your mother say?
HEY!
You were gonna go and do it again, weren't you? Just now! Your mind was about to digres from this!
STOP! Just give it a rest, will ya? That's not gonna help you outta this jam. I'll just keep comin' back!
And stop wigglin' around like you gotta go potty! You're drivin' me nuts! Just stand there and listen!
I'm wastin' my breath here, ain't I? I mean, look at you. You... You just don't listen.
Is there somethin' about this you maybe don't understand? Or is it just that you don't care at all? Is that it?
Listen. I COULD stop and leave it to you how to develop. But where would that get us? Nowhere.
How 'bout playin' a fantasy without any epic battles, no fightin' against the odds to save some magical realm?
Wouldn't it be nice to just lay down your sword, pick a few pretty daisies, and just be...nice?
See my point? That ain't life. And this ain't a fantasy. I'm just askin' that you enjoy life here, and all of its...
...Hey...
Look at me when I'm talkin' to you!
If you hadn't forgot to commit in the first place...
...you wouldn't be here getting your tail chewed off! OK, you ain't got a tail, but it's still your own fault!
Whew...
You know, comin' out here's no picnic for me, either. It really wears a mole out. You think I'm jokin'?
Look at that tunnel, will ya? I have to dig one of those each and every time you reset! I'm only one mole!
So how about you and I stop wastin' each other's time? Whaddaya say?
NO MORE FORGETTING TO COMMIT! All right? We got an understanding?
Did you say "Whatever"? WHAT?!? AARGH!!! You mockin' me?
If that's how you wanna be, then you just earned yourself the chance to hear me again from the beginnin'!
Yeah, you ain't laughin' now! You don't like that idea all that much, do ya, twerp? Well, I don't like it either!
So how about you and I stop wastin' each other's time? Whaddaya say?
Hmmm...
What do I gotta do to get it through your thick skull? Don't you ever listen to what I'm tellin' you here?
Be honest, you wanna get this over with and get back to the code, now, don't you? Am I right?
So how about you and I stop wastin' each other's time? Whaddaya say?
NO MORE FORGETTING TO COMMIT! All right? We got an understanding?
Well, all right, then! As long as we're square, I'm satisfied.
BUT, this is the last time! So help me, if I gotta do this just one more time, there's gonna be bad trouble.
Oh, and before I forget, there's one last thing:
Your hair! Wash it!!!
We clear? Now...
SCRAM!

Graaah!!!
You again!
Stop
jerkin'
my chain!!!
What's it gonna take to make you stop?
Haah...hooo...hah...heh...hmm...phew.
All right! That's it! Today's the day. I'm done! No more takin' it easy on the poor human.
See, I understand you now. It took a while, but I finally see what makes you tick.
Allow me to...elaborate, huh? The whole COMMIT thing? It's your decision, right?
Yeah, freedom of choice, and all that. You're the master of your own destiny, and blah blah blah blah.
That's all fine with me. I'm just tired of the drama.
You wanna just be careless about your COMMITS, right? You love doing that, huh? That's what you really wanna do?
Well, if that's what you're really lookin' for, lemme help you out. Yeah, no problem! I'll hit `git reset --hard` for you.
Everythin' that you've done so far? All that you've worked for? Forget about it. That's right. It's all going bye-bye.
You, my forgetful friend, get to start over.
Well, see ya!



Gotcha!
How you like them apples? Did we break our keyboard? Did we, maybe, kick our TV? Gah ha ha ha ha!
I got your attention now? Huh? Did I knock a little sense into you? All the lights on up there?
You keep goin' this way, and bad things may happen. You don't wanna make me any angrier. Do you?
Anyway, no more bein' stupid! Stop forgetting to commit! All right? Are we clear?
Are we? What? Graahh! You wisin' off?
You wanna play like that, and I'll reset the whole mess! Everything...POOF! Gone! Don't think I won't!
Is that what you want? Huh? That make you happy? No, I didn't THINK so! Too much work for me, too!
Anyway, no more bein' stupid! Stop it! All right? Are we clear?
That's what I wanna hear! As long as we've got an understanding, we can wrap this up and put it to bed.
But I'm not even jokin' about this. No more of this funny business, you hear me?
Oh, yeah, one last thing...
Before you tuck yourself into bed later tonight? Scrub behind those ears! You got potatoes growin'!
Got that?!? Now...
SCRAM!

YOU!!!

So where you goin'? Huh? Lemme ask you something. What did you just do? Yeah, I'm talkin to you!

What do I mean? What do I mean?

You trying to be funny?

COMMIT! I'm talkin' about you forgetting to commit!

Listen to me. You think you can fool me? You're foolin' yourself. It ain't gonna happen.

See, it's like this, all right? Whenever you forget to commit, there's this light in the Committi Center that starts flashin'...

It's so bright it hurts my brain!

Now, don't get me wrong. I understand that you PEOPLE make mistakes. It's genetic or somethin'.

Who knows? Maybe your finger slipped. I don't know and I don't care. What I DO want is for you to do me a favor.

Yeah, do me a favor and answer this one question. Pray tell, is there a way to undo a forgotten COMMIT in your world?

There isn't, is there?

HUH?

Of course not. That would be stupid.

Well I guess there is, but that requires rewriting HISTORY!

Not being able to do things over again? That's...called life, and you best get used to it.

What? What was that? "It's just a side project"? "Don't make such a big deal out of it"?

THAT'S what I'm talkin' about!

Your attitude! It STINKS!

"It's just a side project. Waaah!" What is that? I'll tell you what it is. It's pathetic. You oughta be ashamed.

Huh? What's that? Speak up, you forgetful cheater! You tellin' me you never said that at all?

Hmph. All right. Maybe I had some dirt in my ears. Forget about it. Let's move on.

Lemme just give you some examples of what I'm talkin' about, OK? And make sure you PAY ATTENTION!

Forgetting to commit in small, regular meaningful intervals and then committing everything at once...? Large monolithic commits? Sound familiar?

This is just the kind of juvenile and disgustin' commit dump that we want you to avoid.

Where's the satisfaction in cheatin' through life? Take everythin' as it comes. In its own time. Enjoy it all.

That's noble. That's graceful. And it's a whole lot easier to do here than it is in real life, lemme tell you!

Sigh

I bet you're askin' yourself, "How much longer is this guy gonna go on?" You are, aren't you? Huh?

Ahhh, whatever. Attention span of a flea, that's what you got. All this jawin' tired me out anyway.

I'm gonna let you go, for now, anyway.

BUT you gotta promise me: no more. I'm serious here. Forgetting to commit is completely OFF-LIMITS!

Oh, yeah, and one last thing:

Take a bath!

You got it? Now...

SCRAM!

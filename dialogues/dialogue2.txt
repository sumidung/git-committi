Oh, here we go. You again, huh? I shoulda known...
I had a feeling about you. After all, wanting to do what you're told NOT to do is HUMAN nature.
Listen, you get this whole forgetting to COMMIT thing started, and you'll NEVER stop. I seen it a million times.
You think this is a game? Well, OK...it is a game. But games got rules, and rules got consequences.
Somethin' funny to you? What am I doin' over here, stand-up? You see an APPLAUSE sign up in here?
Look, don't make me come back here again. I'm serious. It ain't like I enjoy these little field trips.
Next time you see me, I'm gonna be wearing my angry hat. And lemme tell you, it's one ugly hat.
Trust me on this one. When I get my motor goin', you'll be here a while. Don't forget to COMMIT again! Now...
SCRAM!

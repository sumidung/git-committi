Graahh!!

Think you're gettin' away with that?

You got another thing comin'!!!

Stop forgetting to commit! Hear me?

What don't you get???

...Haah... ...Hoo...Phew...

All that screamin' at you...everythin' went all black... You see what you're doin' to me? To my health? Huh?

You know, you're the only one who pushes it this far. The only one who fails to understand. ONLY YOU!

You listenin' to me? 'Cause it looks to me like I gotta go through this whole song and dance again.

When the Mono-Commit Alarm sounds, somebody's gotta just drop everythin' and investigate. And that somebody's ME!

Yeah. I know. It's my job, and I gotta deal with it. I ain't lookin' for sympathy! But for cryin' out loud...

It don't matter if I'm eatin', takin' a hot mud bath, readin' Mole Monthly, or catchin' some z's...

When that alarm goes off, I gotta stop what I'm doin' and start diggin' like it was National Diggin' Day!

I know you can't see it from up there, but I'm only wearin' one sock! One! Who lives like this?

This job ain't glamorous, lemme tell ya.

...Hey... You laughin' at me? You CAN'T be laughin' at me!

I swear, just now your nose...it twitched! Yeah! I saw it! Your ugly little pug nose! It was twitchin' like mad!

OK. That's how you want it? All right. I see how it is. The chickens are comin' home to roost now, ain't they?

If that's how you wanna play, then that's how we'll play.

You know, I can see you forgettin' yourself once...maybe twice. It could happen, I guess.

But this time? No two ways about it! It was deliberate! A calculated, cold-blooded act of villainy by a punk!

No more forgive-and-forget Committi for you, pal. Oh, no. Until you show me some real regret, I ain't leavin'!

All right...what to do? They don't exactly cover hoodlums like you in the reset-prevention manual.

Askin' "You got that?" ain't workin'. All that gets me is lip service, and we both know what that's worth.

Hmmm... Got it! Yeah. That's good. OK, listen up, troublemaker. Here's what we're gonna do.

No more of your worthless, I'm-sorry-Mr.-Committi garbage. Now you're gonna have to say EXACTLY what I tell you to!

You screw it up, you do it again! Let's see... Yeah, that'll work.

You ready? Here goes...

Say "[random sentence]"!

(Note: The things come up can range from, "Yes, boss!" to "I stink", "You are my sunshine!", to "I love Resetti" where heart is a Heart icon, and "Reset = Death where (Death) is the little Skull icon, etc)

(If the Player inputs the sentence incorrectly.)

Mr. Resetti:

Wrong!

Nope! No way, twerp! Do it over! Try again!

You ready? Here goes...

Say "[random sentence]"!

(If the Player inputs something offensive)
Mr.Resetti: Wh-what?!?! Gwaah!!!

You little hairball!!!

You think I wasn't gonna read what you wrote there? You oughta be ashamed of yourself! You worm!

You keep on like this, we're gonna be here for a long, LONG time. You readin' me?

Now stop monkeyin' around and do as you're told, [player]!

You ready? Here goes...

Say "[random sentence]"!

(If the Player inputs the sentence correctly)
Mr.resetti: You're bein' sincere, right? You really, truly, no-joke, cross-your-heart-and-hope-to-die mean it? Well? Do ya? Punk?

That thing you just said? Don't forget it!

Well, all right then! As long as you and I are clear on that, I'm one happy, snappy mole.

But, for the love of dirt, no more! It stops here!

Oh, yeah, one last thing.

Before you go to bed? Brush those teeth, will ya?

Understood? Now...

SCRAM!

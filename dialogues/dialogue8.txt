Graaahh!!!

blue in the face...

...and you still don't get it!!!

What's wrong with you?!?

A MONOLITHIC COMMIT!!! That means YOU!!!

Don't give me any lip! You're the one causin' all the problems...

...Hey!! You're doing it again!

Hey! You! Idiot! I thought I made it clear I want you to LOOK at me when I'm talkin' to you!

I said look at ME! Now!

[Extreme Close-Up!]

Whoa!

......I never noticed before, but you got some nice eyes. Yeah, real hypnotic...

Lemme tell you something. This ain't about you, personally, but more about the world in general.

People see somethin' they don't wanna see, and for whatever reason, they pretend they don't see nothin'.

People see a problem they don't wanna deal with, and they pretend they're too busy to be bothered.

This...sort of tendency...is spreadin' like a disease. It's real tragic to say, but that's the world we live in.

Don't that seem sorta...all messed up to you?

I mean, closin' your eyes, hopin' that all the bad stuff is just gonna go away and not bother you no more?

That's...that's what babies do. You hearin' me? Infants. You see what I...

Huh?

Hey! HEY! You! Wake up!

I'm talkin' over here! This is some serious stuff! You got no manners at all, you thumb-suckin' twerp!!!

Graaahhh!!!

That's it! It's go time! This mole's had ENOUGH! Time to pay the piper!

My patience gauge is now officially on EMPTY!!! And the anger gauge is WAY in the red zone!

You and your smug little devil-may-care attitude... I'm gonna tunnel through your HOUSE! Hi-YAAAAA!

YOWWW!

Urk! Massive...leg...cramp...... Blood pressure...skyrocketing... Phew...

I'm not supposed to get so worked up, you know.

My doctor, she warned me about this kinda stuff...

Well! That's it! No more! I'm done for today. I'm goin' home.

Tryin' to keep you in check is bad for my health.

No more forgetting to commit. I'm serious, here.

Oh, yeah, one last thing...

Every now and then, go to bed early! Stayin' up late all the time is for chumps!

You got it? Now...

SCRAM!

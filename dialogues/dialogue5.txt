Hey, you...! WAAAHHH!
What... What's the deal with that thunder?! That really startled me bad! Seriously!
Oh, umm, anyway, I oughta say it's nice to meet you! I'm Committi's older brother. My name's Don.
Yeah, my brother Sonny can be a real headcase. Thanks for puttin' up with his, uh...quirks. Yeah, quirks.
So, Sonny had an urgent errand that he just couldn't pull himself away from. The guy's like a mole dynamo.
So I came in his place. Thanks for openin' up time in your busy schedule to have a little talk with me.
So anyway, if I might begin at the beginnin'...
It seems that our Sonny's been goin' off the deep end once again. He's been poppin' up all over the place.
You know, yellin' at people, gettin' right in their faces, and causin' havoc. On behalf of the family, I apologize.
I know I'm his brother, but I'm sincere when I say that despite his uh...outbursts... he's, uh...he's a good kid.
He's a bit enthusiastic, and, uh...kinda overbearin'. You could even say he's pig-headed. Mole-headed?
Either way, his social skills are real, real unpolished, and his choice of language is, shall we say, questionable.
But...don't forget his heart! It's in the right place! Trust me, there ain't an evil bone in his body!
So, uh, just let him have his little say, and shrug it off. Don't hold it against him. He don't get out much.
Oh, yeah. Right. Business. I guess I gotta take care of a little business, right? I don't wanna get yelled at...
OK, here goes nothin'. Do re mi... Ahem...
Ummm... Forgetting to commit is no good! Don't do it!
The Committis suggest givin' up your forgetful ways... For health reasons. Got it?
...Hmmm...guess that should cover it. About time for me to make tunnels. See ya around. And good luck. Now...
SCRAM!

Hello. Um...allow me to introduce myself. The name's Committi. Mr. Committi.
Have we...met before? At the...office, perhaps? Yeah, whatever.
Anyway, let me just say thanks for using git.
Um...on behalf of everyone at ...I...um...I...
What was the next part? Huh? Aw, forget it! That's enough!
Let's get down to business, whaddaya say? Because you may not know it, but you and I got issues to discuss.
First, let me just tell you what it is I'm doin' here. Just so there are no misunderstandings later on.
You, my friend, didn't regularly commit your changes, didn't you? Huh? Maybe on accident, maybe on purpose, but you didn't commit it.
Or maybe you did, huh? Maybe you just went and turned the power off without committing. Sound familiar?
What? Sorry, what was that? I didn't catch that last bit. Did you just say I'm right? You did what I said you did?
Ah-HAH!!!
All right, you listen and listen good, 'cause I get real angry when I gotta repeat stuff I gotta say.
Not committing... It's like...pressing an emergency call button. You do it and I gotta come read you the riot act. See?
Also, you gotta COMMIT REGULARLY before creating many uncorrelating changes. If you commit everything at once, it's the same as not committing at all.
Well, OK... That last part? I just added that. Why? Because I wanted to.
Forget about your other side projects for a minute, will ya?
I'm here to suggest that you try and develop this project, without forgetting to COMMIT. Got it?
I know what you're thinking: "Whether I COMMIT or not should be up to me. After all, it's my code!"
Well, sorry. Rules are rules, OK? Know what I'm sayin'? Let's not make a big deal out of this. End of discussion.
This bein' our first meeting, I'm gonna let you off easy. Think of this as a friendly warning from me to you.
Oh, one more thing. This is my job. I take it seriously. So next time you see me, it's no more Mr. Nice Mole.
Oh, yeah, and another thing I guess I gotta say here...
I really watched my... language...here today. I'm not usually quite so... you know, so polite.
If I'm bein' truthful here, I gotta tell you... I been told I got what you call an acid tongue. I sorta...scare people.
Hey, that's...who I am. Nothin' I can do about it. What, I'm supposed to say sorry for bein' me?
Look, it's nothin' personal. I ain't tryin' to be mean or cruel or nothin'. I ain't a monster.
For those people who get their feelin's bruised easily, I gotta apologize in advance. Just deal with it, OK?
The deal is, I get paid to be nasty. Crazy world, huh? Ha ha ha ha ha!!!
Well, I figure it's about time for me to get outta here.
So, uh... Yeah. Here's hoping I don't have to come see you no more. Now...
SCRAM!
